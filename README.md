# Cheat Engine is a Memory Editor which can access any process memory 

And with that knowledge we can then say we can access variables of another process memory and change it's value

But How to look for that specific adress in memory ? 

Cheat engine provides scanning by affecting the value and changing it as it's keeps track of all the adresses

Which makes it easy 
We are scanning for the value 100

The value has changed so we look again for the new value and tap next

Now we have one adress and it's represent the variable holding health that we can change 


Ez right ?!
